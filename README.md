# **Nectorforge** 🐝

**Nectorforge** is a **bee-themed website** designed to raise awareness about the crucial role honeybees play in our ecosystem and the importance of protecting them. The project combines **front-end development**, **interactive elements**, and **3D animations** to deliver an engaging and educational web experience. 

This project was created as part of my **first semester** in Computer Science and integrates my leadership role as the **President of the Environmental Society** in college, where I am passionate about **sustainability** and **environmental advocacy**.

## 💡 **Key Features**
- **Interactive 3D Bee Model:** A dynamic, flying 3D bee that follows the user's scroll, offering an engaging visual connection to the theme.
